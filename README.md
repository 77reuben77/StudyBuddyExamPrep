# StudyBuddyExamPrep

This project is the initial draft of an Artificial Tutor Chatbot. Aimed to provide quality, personalized educational assistance at a very low cost using new generative AI technology on the OpenAI API.

It was initially built on the Google Cloud platform and therefore I have not yet integrated all the webhooks and endpoints onto GITHUB.

I am mainly adding this files to GITHUB to for interested party's to view the scope and build of the project.
